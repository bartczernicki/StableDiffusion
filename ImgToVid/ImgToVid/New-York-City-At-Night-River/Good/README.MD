Reasons why these rendeings are considered "Good":  
  * New York City image was auto-segmented by the Gen AI model.  
  * AI model applied animation techniques to the various segments.  
  * River is animated (timelapse).  
  * Sky is animated.  
  * The buildings are properly not animated nor distorted in frames.  

*Note the images below loop from start to finish repeatedly. That is not considered a poor generation just a repeat of the animation
