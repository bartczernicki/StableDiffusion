Reasons why these rendeings are considered "Good":  
  * Black Hole image was auto-segmented by the Gen AI model.  
  * AI model applied animation techniques to the various segments.  
  * The accretion disk is animated to swirl.  
  * The event horizon stay consistent.  
  * The particle jet has a nice animation demonstrated expulsion effect.  
  * Background stars are not interering with black hole animations.  

*Note the images below loop from start to finish repeatedly. That is not considered a poor generation.
