Reasons why these rendeings are considered good:  
* Good - Overall good generations, where the AI model segmented the image, identified the natural animation path and generated a good video.  
* Basic - Simple generations using AI, where they show simple paning. Found in basic photo editing or picture frame software (2024).  
* Bad - Poor generations using AI, where the video output does not have much natural consisency.  

*Note the images below loop from start to finish repeatedly. That is not considered a poor generation.
