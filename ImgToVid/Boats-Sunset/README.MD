**Source Image for video generation - Boats Sunset (Boats-Sunset.png)**  
Navigate to the following folders to see sample generations:  
* Good - Overall good generations, where the AI model segmented the image, identified the natural animation path and generated a good video.  
* Basic - Simple generations using AI, where they show simple panning. Found in basic photo editing or picture frame software (2024).  
    ** Key difference is when panning (left, top, fly over etc.) the Gen AI models can generate new image content beyond the source image boundaries. Non-AI photo software will generally crop the picture and pan to the remainder non-cropped, so while it is "basic" it is still performing some AI enhancements.  
* Bad - Poor generations using AI, where the video output does not have much natural consisency and just feels off.
