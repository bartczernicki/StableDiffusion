**Reasons why these rendeings are considered "Good":**  
  * New York City image was auto-segmented by the Gen AI model.  
  * AI model applied animation techniques to the various segments.  
  * Sky is segmented and animated properly to resemble a sky timelapse.  
  * The buildings are segmented and properly not being distorted.  
  * The foreground river is segmented and properly animated as a flowing river timelapse.  

*Note the images below loop from start to finish repeatedly. That is not considered a poor generation, it is just the animation on repeat.
